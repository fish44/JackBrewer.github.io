            <h1> Welcome to my web page. </h1>

            <h4> (Lets learn HTML!) </h4>

            <p> Before we start let me tell you a little abut myself. This is the 1<sup>st</sup>time that I have taught this course. I was born at a very young age and grew in wisdom and grace until now. Of course, I hope to continueto grow in both wisdom and grace but that will require effort and attention to what is happening in the world and in myself. I hope you learn a lot about web programming and are enlightened by what we do in the class. Good Luck! </p>

            <p> When writing web pages you need to make sure that you are attentive to lots of details like the structure and formatting of the page. I want to <strong> emphasize </strong>to you the importance of this. </p>

            <p> I want to make sure that you understand what I mean so I would like to quote myself.
                <blockquote> It is very important to be aware of all the small details when writing webpages. Afterall, small details can make a big difference. Be conscious of what you are learning and why you are learning it. We will certainly learn a lot in this class but we muxt always exert effort to learn. </blockquote>
